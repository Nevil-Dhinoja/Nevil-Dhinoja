### 2. **Auto-Restock**:
   - Automatically generate purchase orders when stock levels are low, reducing human intervention.

### 3. **Waste Reduction**:
   - Implement machine learning models to identify slow-moving stock and suggest promotional offers to clear excess inventory.

### 4. **Integration**:
   - Integrate with external inventory or eCommerce systems for real-time stock updates.

## System Flow

### 1. **Frontend Dashboard**:
   - Displays real-time inventory data and predictions.
   - Shows alerts for low stock or slow-moving inventory.
   - Allows warehouse managers to view and approve auto-restocking suggestions.

### 2. **Backend Services**:
   - **API Routes**:
     - `/get_inventory`: Fetch current inventory levels.
     - `/predict_demand`: Predict future demand for products.
     - `/auto_restock`: Generate purchase orders based on stock levels and predictions.
   - **Machine Learning Models**:
     - **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future demand based on historical sales data.
     - **Stock Optimization**: Suggest promotional offers for slow-moving stock.
     - **Auto-Restock**: Automatically suggest restock actions based on predictions.

### 3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - **Demand Prediction**: Train a model using historical sales data to predict future demand for products.
   - **Stock Optimization**: Identify slow-moving items and suggest sales or promotions.
   - **Restock Suggestion**: Automatically generate purchase orders for products with low stock based on demand predictions.

   - `product_id` (Primary Key)
   - `product_name`
   - `category`
   - `stock_level`
   - `price`

### 2. **Sales Table**:
   - `transaction_id` (Primary Key)
   - `product_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `quantity_sold`
   - `transaction_date`
   - `total_sales_value`

### 3. **Predictions Table**:
   - `prediction_id` (Primary Key)
   - `product_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `predicted_demand`
   - `predicted_restock_qty`
   - `prediction_date`

## Steps to Build

### 1. **Setup the Project Structure**:
   - Initialize a Python environment and install necessary packages:
     ```bash
     pip install flask pandas scikit-learn psycopg2 sqlalchemy
     ```

### 2. **Backend Development**:
   - Create the backend with **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
   - Implement the API routes:
     - `/get_inventory`: Fetch current inventory data.
     - `/predict_demand`: Provide demand prediction.
     - `/auto_restock`: Generate purchase orders for low-stock products.

### 3. **Database Setup**:
   - Set up **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**.
   - Create tables for **inventory**, **sales**, and **predictions**.
   - Store transaction data, inventory updates, and machine learning predictions.

### 4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Collect historical sales data.
   - Train a **RandomForestRegressor** or another suitable model for demand prediction.
   - Use the trained model to predict demand and suggest restocking orders.

### 5. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build a **React.js** or **Vue.js** app for displaying inventory levels, demand predictions, and restock alerts.
   - Use **Axios** to fetch data from the backend API.

### 6. **Integrate ML Models**:
   - Load the trained machine learning model in the backend.
   - Make predictions for future demand and stock optimization based on historical sales data.

### 7. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for API endpoints.
   - Test machine learning models for accuracy and prediction reliability.
   - Use **Jest** or **Mocha** for frontend testing.

### 8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the backend on **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean**.
   - Deploy the frontend on **Netlify** or **Vercel**.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy Flask API to **Heroku**:
     ```bash
     git init
     heroku create
     git push heroku master
     ```
   - Use **AWS** or **DigitalOcean** for production-grade hosting.

### 2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy React app to **Netlify**:
     - Run the following command:
       ```bash
       npm run build
       netlify deploy
       ```

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Retrain Models**: Regularly retrain the model using updated sales data to improve predictions.
2. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Use metrics like RMSE, MAE to evaluate prediction accuracy.
3. **Add More Features**: Incorporate additional features like external factors (e.g., weather, events) for better predictions.
